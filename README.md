# mississippi-kings-24-replayserver
UDP- and Web/Socket Server where I visualized my Software Challenge Germany 2024 replays

This NodeJS server ran locally in my Network where my [Bot](https://github.com/YoEnte/mississippi-kings-24-py) could connect via UDP and send it's calculated Match data. \
When processed, I could lookup the match data in the Webbrowser and have a perfectly formatted visualization of the data for quick and easy debugging and finding out why my bot choose a move or why not. 

I created this tool, because the data for one individual move just flooded my terminal (multiple kilobytes of object/array data) and was impossible to read quickly/consistently.

In the repo are also some example matches from the last days before the finals included, have fun testing the tool
